# 👋 Hi, I’m Seray Üstün

### 🎓 Final-Year Computer Engineering Student | Data Science & Applied AI Explorer

I am a final-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in **Data Science** and **Applied AI**, particularly in building reliable machine learning systems for real-world use cases. While I use Computer Vision as a practical application area, my primary interest lies in understanding data behavior, refining model logic, and addressing reliability challenges in safety-aware systems.

As a student, I approach projects as learning-driven engineering efforts—aimed at developing solid analytical foundations, clean pipelines, and thoughtful design choices rather than claiming finalized research outcomes.

## 💎 Featured Project: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project was developed as a collaborative team effort in 2025 and focuses on detecting driver fatigue through a hybrid deep learning and heuristic-based approach.

### My Contributions & Technical Focus

- **Model Architecture (DrowsyNet):** Contributed to the design and training of a CNN built on a **MobileNetV2** backbone, selected for its balance between performance and computational efficiency.
- **Performance & Validation:** Achieved a peak **validation accuracy of 93.06%** with a stable **F1-score of 0.93**, emphasizing consistency rather than single-metric optimization.
- **Systematic Optimization:** Applied **Bayesian Optimization** to tune key hyperparameters such as learning rate, dropout, and regularization, moving beyond manual trial-and-error.
- **Hybrid Logic Integration:** Combined CNN-based predictions with **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** heuristics to enforce temporal reasoning and reduce false positive fatigue alerts.
- **Safety-Oriented Design:** Implemented a two-stage warning mechanism, issuing a mild alert after 3 seconds and a critical alert after 6 seconds of sustained eye closure.
- **Tech Stack:** `PyTorch`, `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, `NumPy`

## 🔍 Current Interests & Learning Goals

I am particularly interested in problem settings where standard machine learning approaches face limitations.

- **Imbalanced Learning:** Exploring analytical and modeling strategies beyond basic resampling techniques.
- **Causal-Aware Thinking:** Developing an interest in causal-inspired perspectives for data generation and evaluation, especially in scenarios where conventional assumptions break down.
- **Hybrid Systems:** Combining interpretable rule-based logic with neural models to improve robustness.
- **Model Reliability:** Focusing on temporal consistency, error analysis, and reducing brittle model behavior.

These areas reflect topics I am actively learning and experimenting with, rather than finalized research contributions.
