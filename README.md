# 👋 Hi, I’m Seray Üstün

**Final-Year Computer Engineering Student | Applied AI & Data Science**

I build machine learning systems with a focus on data reliability and real-world behavior. While I leverage Computer Vision as a practical application area, my primary goal is to understand why data behaves the way it does and to design robust, safety-aware model logic.

## 💎 Featured Project: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A collaborative project developed in 2025, focusing on a hybrid monitoring framework to support road safety.

- **Architecture:** Contributed to **DrowsyNet**, a CNN based on **MobileNetV2**, designed for efficient real-time inference.
- **Performance:** Reached a peak **validation accuracy of 93.06%** with a stable **F1-score of 0.93**.
- **Optimization:** Applied **Bayesian Optimization** to systematically tune model hyperparameters.
- **Hybrid Logic:** Combined CNN predictions with **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** heuristics for temporal fatigue reasoning.
- **Alert System:** Two-stage design — 3s *“Take a break”* and 6s *“Serious Alert”*.
- **Tech Stack:** `PyTorch`, `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, `NumPy`
